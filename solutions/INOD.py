Find the number of internal nodes of an unrooted binary tree with n leaves
A tree is an undirected graph where all vertices are connected and no cycles are present,
and a binary tree is a tree where each internal node has degree 3
In other words, there is one and only one path that connects any two edges in a tree

The number of internal nodes of an unrooted binary tree is the number of edges minus 2
