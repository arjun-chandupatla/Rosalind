'''
Find the number of internal nodes of an unrooted binary tree with n leaves
A tree is an undirected graph where all vertices are connected
In other words, there is one and only one path that connects any two edges in a tree

An unrooted tree is a tree where every internal node has a degree of 3
In contrast, a rooted tree has a root with degree 2, while all other internal nodes have degree 3
